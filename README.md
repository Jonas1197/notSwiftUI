# NotSwiftUI

NotSwiftUI is designed to help you create UI components quickly and efficiently with code!

 Capitalizing on the idea that most of the UI elements we as developers use day-to-day are basically all UIViews, NotSwiftUI allows you to declare all of those elements in a simple and orgiznied fashion. Moreover with NotSwiftUI all of your aesthetic configuration can be done in the same way.

 All that is done in a SwiftUI-ish way, which will definitely reduce the number of lines of code you write, as well as help you achieve a more readable and better looking code!
