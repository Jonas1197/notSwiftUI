# NotSwiftUI

Simple Unified Object Declaration (SudoD) is here to help you create a UI quickly and efficiently with code! Capitalizing on the idea that most of the UI elements we as developers use day-to-day are basically all UIView, SudoD allows you to declare all of those elements in a simple and orgiznied fashion. Moreover with SudoD all of your aesthetic configuration can be done in the same way. All that is done in a SwiftUI-ish way, which will definitely reduce the number of lines of code you write, as well as help you achieve a more readable and better looking code!
